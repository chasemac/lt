                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-0">After creating two companies and selling the second one to Intuit, I shifted gears from working in finance and operations to learn mobile software development. Making apps and building software captivated me because it is the perfect mix of logic and creativity.</p>

                        <h2>DOGpreneur</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-0">I'm a UC Santa Barbara grad and a self-motivated entrepreneur who turned a successful college project into a business called Dura Doggie (Durable Ideas). Our first product was a truck brake diaphragm with a logo on it that my mom created. My dad brought one home from work when I was a kid and my dog never chewed through it.</p>

                        <h2>Lettuce Help Your Business</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-0">At Dura Doggie, I oversaw all operations and managed finances. My partners and I saw a real need for a simple inventory management system and launched Lettuce. Lettuce was a software company, which provided simple order and inventory management for product-based businesses. As Director of Operations, I managed the Finance, Customer Support, Quality Assurance and Human Resources departments. The acquisition of Lettuce by Intuit sparked a temporary consulting practice that led me back into the pet industry.</p>

                        <h2>Mobile Software Developer</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-0">As the mobile developer at Anivive, I led the creation of an application to pursue Aniviveâ€™s ambitious goal of modernizing clinical trials. I built the app prototype in Swift, but our development team quickly decided to switch to React Native, so that it could compile to both iOS and Android. I also began working on another project that included creating a machine learning model in a Native Module (iOS) for image recognition. In June 2020 I joined a team at Capital Group working on an internal application.</p>

                        <h2>Passion</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-0">Over two decades ago, I picked up a video camera and passion for film sparked inside of me. I honed my skills making video announcements in Jr. High and High School. I pursued film in college, but got side-tracked and became an entrepreneur. I switched majors with the goal of someday jumping back into film on the business side. 
                            <br><br>
                            In September 2018, a desire to invest in film began pounding in my heart. I asked my film director friend, Brian Ivie, for a way to jump in. Later that day he sent a link to a documentary he created called Emanuel. He asked if I would watch it and consider investing in the promotion & advertising budget. As I watched I was deeply moved by the powerful real-life story of people choosing forgiveness over hate. 
                            <br><br>
                            It's a movie and a message for every one of us. I'm grateful for the opportunity to support it. I encourage you to check out the trailer and purchase it on amazon or watch it on your next United flight. https://www.emanuelmovie.com.
